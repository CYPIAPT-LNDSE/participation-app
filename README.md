# participation-app

## What?

A mobile focused web application that allows a young person to evaluate their current participation in their care.

## Why? 

## How?

Users will be able to answer questions about their participation in an entertaining way using blobs to indicate the strength of a particular kind of involvement. Users will then be able to adjust these at the end before submitting their results.

On submitting a user will see an interactive ladder with a score that corresponds to their particular level of participation. Users will be able to see information about the different levels and get tips on how to move to each of them if they want to.

Users will be able to save and share their results if they want.
